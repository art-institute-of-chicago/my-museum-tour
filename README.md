# Custom Tours ![Build status badge](https://github.com/art-institute-of-chicago/custom-tours/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

> [!WARNING]<br>
> This README is currently a work in progress.


## Summary of the project

This is React app drives the custom tours builder on the main [artic.edu website](https://artic.edu/custom-tours). It provided an interactive client-side interface for users to create custom tours.

## Features

> TODO:
> What are all the bells and whistles that are significant or unique to this project?
>
> * What's the main functionality
> * What new thing does this project provide?
> * What unique feature does this project include?

## Overview
> [!NOTE]<br>
> TODO:
>
> Describe the architecture in which this project fits, and point to any other repos that make up the full stack of software. Describe how each piece fits together.

## Requirements

- [Node.js / npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

> [!IMPORTANT]<br>
> Although optional, we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to match the version of Node used in this project before running the install command, or the npm scripts described below.
>
> If you encounter problems and aren't using the version of Node shown in the [.nvmrc](.nvmrc) file, you should try aligning your node version to this first. This represents a known compatibility with the code here and our dependencies.


## Installing

Install the dependencies in the project root with:

```bash
npm ci
```

## Developing locally

If you want to develop new features on this project locally, there's various commands and actions you can perform using the npm scripts as described below.

A full list of thse scripts is available in [`package.json`](package.json), or by running `npm run`.

### Compiling and previewing changes

    <tr>
      <td><code>npm run test:gui</code></td>
      <td>Will start the local dev server and run the component tests with the interactive GUI</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>npm run test</code></td>
      <td>Starts the dev server as above, but instead runs the tests without the GUI</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Linting the code

    <tr>
      <th width="300px">Command</th>
      <th width="800px">Action</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>npm run lint</code></td>
      <td>Will lint (and fix where possible) all problems in the code</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Consuming this package

The expectation is that the code generated by this project will live within [artic.edu](https://www.artic.edu/), but technically the same rules apply if another website or application wants to use it.


### Requirements

- Node.js
- React (>=16)
- ReactDOM (>=16)

### Installation

1. In your `package.json` file add a new dependency that points to this repository:

```json
{
  "custom-tour-builder": "git+ssh://git@github.com/art-institute-of-chicago/custom-tours.git#main",
}
```

> [!NOTE]<br>
> The fragment (i.e. "#main") of the url shown above refers to the branch. There might be some instances (such as developing a new feature) where you'd like to reference a different branch, which can be achieved by updating this to the corresponding branch and running `npm i custom-tour-builder`

2. Run `npm i custom-tour-builder`

3. The default export for the primary component of this app can be accessed as you would any other npm package using ESModules:
```js
import CustomTourBuilder from 'custom-tour-builder';
```

4. Your app is responsible for mounting this component to the DOM using ReactDOM

React 16:
```js
  ReactDOM.render(<CustomTourBuilder/>, container);
```


React > 16:
```js
ReactDOM.createRoot(container).render(<CustomTourBuilder/>);
```
